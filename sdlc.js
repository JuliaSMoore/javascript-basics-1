// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = `This is the second step, in which the end goal is to underastad what the reqirements for the designing process are.`
const design = `This is the third step, in which the actual designing of a sortware or a new feature is done. The gathered information from the first two steps is used as an input.`
const implementation = `This is the forth step, in which the design is translated into a code.`
const testingIntegration = `This is the fifth step, in which once the coding is complete, testing starts and then after testing the software of fearure is deployed`
const maintain = `This is the last step in Software Development Lifecycle, in which all the bugs and issues are being fixed in a timely manner.`
